# ImagineLoop
ImagineLoop: Neural oscillator-driven imagination engine.

A PyTorch-based “Imagination Loop” engine that brings recursive symbolic oscillation to life. ImagineLoop implements the Weighted Adaptive Harmonic Oscillator (WAHO) model—fusing multi-modal inputs, dynamic feedback loops, and non-linear entropy decay—to simulate human-like creative reasoning. Explore how attention cycles, symbolic tension, and inspiration noise converge into coherent insights, ready to power next-generation AI applications in storytelling, design, and decision-making.
